  "prompt_text": "# Task Prompt:\n\nDesign an efficient algorithm to analyze and visualize the global spread of COVID-19 cases over time, incorporating data from various countries and regions.\n\n**Step 1: Data Collection**\nGather a comprehensive dataset containing daily COVID-19 case numbers for at least 100 countries and regions worldwide. This dataset should cover a period of two years (2020-2022) with a granularity of one day. Assume the dataset is stored in a CSV file named `covid_data.csv`.\n\n**Step 2: Data Cleaning**\nWrite code to handle potential edge cases such as missing values, inconsistent data formats, and outliers. Ensure that your solution can identify and remove duplicate entries.\n\n**Step 3: Data Analysis**\nImplement a function to calculate key metrics for each country/region, including:\n\n* Total confirmed cases\n* Average daily cases over time\n* Highest peak of daily cases within the two-year period\n* Percentage increase in total cases from the start to the end of the period\n\nStore these calculated metrics in a new pandas DataFrame named `country_metrics`.\n\n**Step 4: Visualization**\nUse a suitable library (e.g., Matplotlib or Seaborn) to create an interactive dashboard displaying:\n\n* A world map with country-specific case numbers and colors representing the magnitude of cases\n* Time-series plots for each country/region, showing daily cases over time\n* Bar charts comparing the top 5 countries with the highest total cases\n\n**Step 5: Edge-Case Handling**\nConsider and address potential edge cases such as:\n\n* Handling regions or countries with missing data for extended periods\n* Displaying accurate labels and annotations on plots to avoid confusion\n* Ensuring proper handling of extreme values (e.g., very high case numbers)\n\nProvide a clear, readable code implementation with explanations for each step. Ensure that the solution is efficient, well-structured, and suitable for large datasets.\n\nNote: This prompt is designed to test your ability to tackle complex tasks involving data analysis, visualization, and edge-case handling. The expected output will be a comprehensive Python code snippet with thorough explanations and example usage.",
